# backend
Flask backend for the Pitt Quantum Repository website.  
  
`venv/` is included so that the backend will be standard across machines.  
  
To start venv, run `. venv/bin/activate`  

### First run  
Upon first run, install Flask in venv via `pip install Flask`  
Then, to test the server, run `python server.py`  

### Routes  
Routes are defined in `pqr/views.py`


### Grunt  
Added grunt for watching LESS files for auto compiling. Will be useful for a lot of other things too.
